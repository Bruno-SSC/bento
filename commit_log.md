    just setup the github, the starting files, started working on the main grid, etc. Basic stuff.

    basically done with the desktop elements.

    updated the classes name for better semantic.

    moved all grid items for isolated components and fairly progress (almost everything) in the mobile base styling.

    I'm done with this project already. It's enough ready.
